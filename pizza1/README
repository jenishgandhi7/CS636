Note: to run this project on Windows or Linux/Mac with H2 (easiest way):
0. Linux/Mac only: use "chmod +x *.sh database/*.sh" to make all shell scripts executable.

1. cd to the database directory here.
   Then "runH2Script createdb.sql"  (runH2Script.sh on Linux/Mac) to load the H2 database using createdb.sql
   
2. Use "mvn clean package" when cd'd to this directory to build the jar (in the target subdirectory)

3. Then "runOnH2 SystemTest"  (runOnH2.sh on Linux/Mac) to run SystemTest out of the jar
   Similarly "runOnH2 TakeOrder" and "runOnH2 ShopAdmin"

To use a real DB (once available): you need to define environment variables.
 For Oracle database, set up env variables ORACLE_USER, ORACLE_PW, ORACLE_SITE
 For MySQL use, set up env vars MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PW, MYSQL_SITE
 To run these at home, you need to set up tunnels for the JDBC connections.
See DatabaseSetup linked to the class web page.
